AUDITCTL(8)          System Administration Utilities          AUDITCTL(8)

```

## https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#NAMENAME [top](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#top_of_page)

```

       auditctl - a utility to assist controlling the kernel's audit
       system

```

## https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#SYNOPSISSYNOPSIS [top](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#top_of_page)

```

       auditctl [options]

```

## https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#DESCRIPTIONDESCRIPTION [top](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#top_of_page)

```

       The auditctl program is used to configure kernel options related
       to auditing, to see status of the configuration, and to load
       discretionary audit rules.

```

## https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#CONFIGURATION_OPTIONSCONFIGURATION OPTIONS [top](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#top_of_page)

```

       -b backlog
              Set max number (limit) of outstanding audit buffers allowed
              (Kernel Default=64) If all buffers are full, the failure
              flag is consulted by the kernel for action.

       --backlog_wait_time wait_time
              Set the time for the kernel to wait (Kernel Default 60*HZ)
              when the backlog limit is reached before queuing more audit
              events to be transferred to auditd. The number must be
              greater than or equal to zero and less than 10 times the
              default value.

       --reset_backlog_wait_time_actual
              Reset the actual backlog wait time counter shown by the
              status command.

       -c     Continue loading rules in spite of an error. This
              summarizes the results of loading the rules. The exit code
              will not be success if any rule fails to load.

       -D     Delete all rules and watches. This can take a key option
              (-k), too.

       -e [0..2]
              Set enabled flag. When 0 is passed, this can be used to
              temporarily disable auditing. When 1 is passed as an
              argument, it will enable auditing. To lock the audit
              configuration so that it can't be changed, pass a 2 as the
              argument. Locking the configuration is intended to be the
              last command in audit.rules for anyone wishing this feature
              to be active. Any attempt to change the configuration in
              this mode will be audited and denied. The configuration can
              only be changed by rebooting the machine.

       -f [0..2]
              Set failure mode 0=silent 1=printk 2=panic. This option
              lets you determine how you want the kernel to handle
              critical errors. Example conditions where this mode may
              have an effect includes: transmission errors to userspace
              audit daemon, backlog limit exceeded, out of kernel memory,
              and rate limit exceeded. The default value is 1. Secure
              environments will probably want to set this to 2.

       -h, --help
              Help

       -i     When given by itself, ignore errors when reading rules from
              a file. This causes auditctl to always return a success
              exit code. If passed as an argument to -s then it gives an
              interpretation of the numbers to human readable words if
              possible.

       --loginuid-immutable
              This option tells the kernel to make loginuids unchangeable
              once they are set. Changing loginuids requires
              CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL. So, its not something that can be done
              by unprivileged users. Setting this makes loginuid tamper-
              proof, but can cause some problems in certain kinds of
              containers.

       -q mount-point,subtree
              If you have an existing directory watch and bind or move
              mount another subtree in the watched subtree, you need to
              tell the kernel to make the subtree being mounted
              equivalent to the directory being watched. If the subtree
              is already mounted at the time the directory watch is
              issued, the subtree is automatically tagged for watching.
              Please note the comma separating the two values. Omitting
              it will cause errors.

       -r rate
              Set limit in messages/sec (0=none). If this rate is non-
              zero and is exceeded, the failure flag is consulted by the
              kernel for action. The default value is 0.

       --reset-lost
              Reset the lost record counter shown by the status command.

       -R file
              Read and execute auditctl commands from a file. The
              commands are executed line-by-line, in the order that they
              appear in the file. The file must be owned by root and not
              readable by other users, or else it will be rejected. Empty
              lines are skipped. Lines starting with the '#' character
              are treated as comment lines. Each line is executed as if
              it was provided to auditctl as command line arguments.
              Since auditctl is the one reading the file and not a shell
              such as bash, do not escape special shell characters. See
              the EXAMPLES section for an example.

       --signal signal
              Send a signal to the audit daemon. You must have privileges
              to do this. Supported signals are TERM, HUP, USR1, USR2,
              CONT
               and user friendly versions stop, reload, rotate, resume,
              state.

       -t     Trim the subtrees after a mount command.

```

## https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#STATUS_OPTIONSSTATUS OPTIONS [top](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#top_of_page)

```

       -l     List all rules 1 per line. Two more options may be given to
              this command. You can give either a key option (-k) to list
              rules that match a key or a (-i) to have a0 through a3
              interpreted to help determine the syscall argument values
              are correct .

       -m text
              Send a user space message into the audit system. This can
              only be done if you have CAP_AUDIT_WRITE capability
              (normally the root user has this). The resulting event will
              be the USER type.

       -s     Report the kernel's audit subsystem status. It will tell
              you the in-kernel values that can be set by -e, -f, -r, and
              -b options. The pid value is the process number of the
              audit daemon. Note that a pid of 0 indicates that the audit
              daemon is not running. The lost entry will tell you how
              many event records that have been discarded due to the
              kernel audit queue overflowing. The backlog field tells how
              many event records are currently queued waiting for auditd
              to read them. This option can be followed by the -i to get
              a couple fields interpreted.

       -v     Print the version of auditctl.

```

## https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#RULE_OPTIONSRULE OPTIONS [top](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#top_of_page)

```

       -a [list,action|action,list]
              Append rule to the end of list with action. Please note the
              comma separating the two values. Omitting it will cause
              errors. The fields may be in either order. It could be
              list,action or action,list. The following describes the
              valid list names:

              task   Add a rule to the per task list. This rule list is
                     used only at the time a task is created -- when
                     fork() or clone() are called by the parent task.
                     When using this list, you should only use fields
                     that are known at task creation time, such as the
                     uid, gid, etc.

              exit   Add a rule to the syscall exit list. This list is
                     used upon exit from a system call to determine if an
                     audit event should be created.

              user   Add a rule to the user message filter list. This
                     list is used by the kernel to filter events
                     originating in user space before relaying them to
                     the audit daemon. It should be noted that the only
                     fields that are valid are: uid, auid, gid, pid,
                     subj_user, subj_role, subj_type, subj_sen, subj_clr,
                     msgtype, and executable name. All other fields will
                     be treated as non-matching. It should be understood
                     that any event originating from user space from a
                     process that has CAP_AUDIT_WRITE will be recorded
                     into the audit trail. This means that the most
                     likely use for this filter is with rules that have
                     an action of never since nothing has to be done to
                     allow events to be recorded.

              exclude
                     Add a rule to the event type exclusion filter list.
                     This list is used to filter events that you do not
                     want to see. For example, if you do not want to see
                     any avc messages, you would using this list to
                     record that. Events can be excluded by process ID,
                     user ID, group ID, login user ID, message type,
                     subject context, or executable name. The action is
                     ignored and uses its default of "never".

              filesystem
                     Add a rule that will be applied to a whole
                     filesystem. The filesystem must be identified with a
                     fstype field. Normally this filter is used to
                     exclude any events for a whole filesystem such as
                     tracefs or debugfs.

              io_uring
                     Add a rule to the io_uring syscall filter. Rules
                     against this filter specify the syscall operation
                     using the -S syscall notion explained below. You can
                     add a key field to the rule so that it may be
                     grouped with other rules watching the same
                     underlying syscall.

       The following describes the valid actions for the rule:

              never  No audit records will be generated. This can be used
                     to suppress event generation. In general, you want
                     suppressions at the top of the list instead of the
                     bottom. This is because the event triggers on the
                     first matching rule.

              always Allocate an audit context, always fill it in at
                     syscall entry time, and always write out a record at
                     syscall exit time.

       -A list,action
              Add rule to the beginning list with action.

       -C [f=f | f!=f]
              Build an inter-field comparison rule: field, operation,
              field. You may pass multiple comparisons on a single
              command line. Each one must start with -C. Each inter-field
              equation is anded with each other as well as equations
              starting with -F to trigger an audit record. There are 2
              operators supported - equal, and not equal. Valid fields
              are:

              auid, uid, euid, suid, fsuid, obj_uid; and gid, egid, sgid,
              fsgid, obj_gid

              The two groups of uid and gid cannot be mixed. But any
              comparison within the group can be made. The obj_uid/gid
              fields are collected from the object of the event such as a
              file or directory.

       -d list,action
              Delete rule from list with action. The rule is deleted only
              if it exactly matches syscall name(s) and every field name
              and value.

       -F [n=v | n!=v | n<v | n>v | n<=v | n>=v | n&v | n&=v]
              Build a rule field: name, operation, value. You may have up
              to 64 fields passed on a single command line. Each one must
              start with -F. Each field equation is anded with each other
              (as well as equations starting with -C) to trigger an audit
              record. There are 8 operators supported - equal, not equal,
              less than, greater than, less than or equal, and greater
              than or equal, bit mask, and bit test respectively. Bit
              test will "and" the values and check that they are equal,
              bit mask just "ands" the values. Fields that take a user ID
              may instead have the user's name; the program will convert
              the name to user ID. The same is true of group names. Valid
              fields are:

              a0, a1, a2, a3
                     Respectively, the first 4 arguments to a syscall.
                     Note that string arguments are not supported. This
                     is because the kernel is passed a pointer to the
                     string. Triggering on a pointer address value is not
                     likely to work. So, when using this, you should only
                     use on numeric values. This is most likely to be
                     used on platforms that multiplex socket or IPC
                     operations.

              arch   The CPU architecture of the syscall. The arch can be
                     found doing 'uname -m'. If you do not know the arch
                     of your machine but you want to use the 32 bit
                     syscall table and your machine supports 32 bit, you
                     can also use b32 for the arch. The same applies to
                     the 64 bit syscall table, you can use b64.  In this
                     way, you can write rules that are somewhat arch
                     independent because the family type will be auto
                     detected. However, syscalls can be arch specific and
                     what is available on x86_64, may not be available on
                     ppc. The arch directive should precede the -S option
                     so that auditctl knows which internal table to use
                     to look up the syscall numbers.

              auid   The original ID the user logged in with. Its an
                     abbreviation of audit uid. Sometimes its referred to
                     as loginuid. Either the user account text or number
                     may be used.

              devmajor
                     Device Major Number

              devminor
                     Device Minor Number

              dir    Full Path of Directory to watch. This will place a
                     recursive watch on the directory and its whole
                     subtree. It can only be used on exit list. See "-w".

              egid   Effective Group ID. May be numeric or the groups
                     name.

              euid   Effective User ID. May be numeric or the user
                     account name.

              exe    Absolute path to application that while executing
                     this rule will apply to. It supports = and !=
                     operators. Note that you can only use this once for
                     each rule.

              exit   Exit value from a syscall. If the exit code is an
                     errno, you may use the text representation, too.

              fsgid  Filesystem Group ID. May be numeric or the groups
                     name.

              fstype File system type. This is used with the filesystem
                     rule list. The only values supported are cgroup,
                     cgroup2, debugfs and tracefs.

              fsuid  Filesystem User ID. May be numeric or the user
                     account name.

              filetype
                     The target file's type. Can be either file, dir,
                     socket, link, character, block, or fifo.

              gid    Group ID. May be numeric or the groups name.

              inode  Inode Number

              key    Set a filter key on an audit rule. The filter key is
                     an arbitrary string of text that can be up to 31
                     bytes long. It can uniquely identify the audit
                     records produced by a rule. Typical use is for when
                     you have several rules that together satisfy a
                     security requirement. The key value can be searched
                     on with ausearch so that no matter which rule
                     triggered the event, you can find its results. The
                     key can also be used on delete all (-D) and list
                     rules (-l) to select rules with a specific key. You
                     may have more than one key on a rule if you want to
                     be able to search logged events in multiple ways or
                     if you have an auditd plugin that uses a key to aid
                     its analysis.

              msgtype
                     This is used to match the event's record type. It
                     should only be used on the exclude or user filter
                     lists.

              path   Insert a watch for the file system object at path.
                     You cannot insert a watch to the top level
                     directory. This is prohibited by the kernel.
                     Wildcards are not supported either and will generate
                     a warning. The way that watches work is by tracking
                     the inode internally. This can only be used on exit
                     list.

              perm   Permission filter for file operations. Supply the
                     access type that a file system watch will trigger
                     on. r=read, w=write, x=execute, a=attribute change.
                     These permissions are not the standard file
                     permissions, but rather the kind of syscall that
                     would do this kind of thing. The read & write
                     syscalls are omitted from this set since they would
                     overwhelm the logs. But rather for reads or writes,
                     the open flags are looked at to see what permission
                     was requested. The perm field can only be used on
                     exit list. You can use this without specifying a
                     syscall and the kernel will select the syscalls that
                     satisfy the access permissions being requested. This
                     also requires supplying an arch parameter before the
                     perm field. This way the kernel can better determine
                     what syscalls are needed. Not supplying an arch will
                     result in all system calls being subject to audit.
                     This will lower system performance.

                     its false/no. When writing a rule, use a 1 for
                     true/yes and a 0 for false/no

              suid   Saved User ID. See getresuid(2) man page.

              uid    User ID. May be numeric or the user account name.

       -k key Set a filter key on an audit rule. This is deprecated when
              used with watches. Convert any watches to the syscall form
              of rules. It is still valid for use with deleting or
              listing rules.

       -p [r|w|x|a]
              Describe the permission access type that a file system
              watch will trigger on. This is deprecated. Convert watches
              to the syscall form.

       -S [Syscall name or number|all]
              Any syscall name or number may be used. The word 'all' may
              also be used.  If the given syscall is made by a program,
              then start an audit record. If a field rule is given and no
              syscall is specified, it will default to all syscalls. You
              may also specify multiple syscalls in the same rule by
              using multiple -S options in the same rule. Doing so
              improves performance since fewer rules need to be
              evaluated. Alternatively, you may pass a comma separated
              list of syscall names. If you are on a bi-arch system, like
              x86_64, you should be aware that auditctl simply takes the
              text, looks it up for the native arch (in this case b64)
              and sends that rule to the kernel. If there are no
              additional arch directives, IT WILL APPLY TO BOTH 32 & 64
              BIT SYSCALLS. This can have undesirable effects since there
              is no guarantee that any syscall has the same number on
              both 32 and 64 bit interfaces. You will likely want to
              control this and write 2 rules, one with arch equal to b32
              and one with b64 to make sure the kernel finds the events
              that you intend. See the arch field discussion for more
              info.

       -w path
              Place a watch on path. If the path is a file, it's almost
              the same as using the -F path option on a syscall rule. If
              the watch is on a directory, it's almost the same as using
              the -F dir option on a syscall rule. The -w form of writing
              watches is for backwards compatibility and is deprecated
              due to poor system performance.  Convert watches of this
              form to the syscall based form. The only valid options when
              using a watch are the -p and -k.

       -W path
              Remove a watch for the file system object at path. The rule
              must match exactly. See -d discussion for more info.

## https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#PERFORMANCE_TIPSPERFORMANCE TIPS [top](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#top_of_page)

```

       Syscall rules get evaluated for each syscall for every program. If
       you have 10 syscall rules, every program on your system will delay
       during a syscall while the audit system evaluates each rule. Too
       many syscall rules will hurt performance. Try to combine as many
       as you can whenever the filter, action, key, and fields are
       identical. For example:

       auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S openat -F success=0
       auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S truncate -F success=0

       could be re-written as one rule:

       auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S openat -S truncate -F success=0

       Also, try to use file system auditing wherever practical. This
       improves performance. For example, if you were wanting to capture
       all failed opens & truncates like above, but were only concerned
       about files in /etc and didn't care about /usr or /sbin, its
       possible to use this rule:

       auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S openat,truncate -F dir=/etc -F success=0

       This will be higher performance since the kernel will not evaluate
       it each and every syscall. It will be handled by the filesystem
       auditing code and only checked on filesystem related syscalls.

```

```

       To see all syscalls made by a specific program:

       # By pid:
       auditctl -a always,exit -S all -F pid=1005
       # By executable path
       auditctl -a always,exit -S all -F exe=/usr/bin/ls

       To see files opened by a specific user:

       auditctl -a always,exit -S openat -F auid=510

       To see unsuccessful openat calls:

       auditctl -a always,exit -S openat -F success=0

       To watch a file for changes (2 ways to express):

       auditctl -w /etc/shadow -p wa # Note this slows the system
       auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -F path=/etc/shadow -F perm=wa

       To recursively watch a directory for changes (2 ways to express):

       auditctl -w /etc/ -p wa # Note this slows the system
       auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -F dir=/etc/ -F perm=wa

       To see if an admin is accessing other user's files:

       auditctl -a always,exit -F dir=/home/ -F uid=0 -C auid!=obj_uid

       This is an example rules file:

       # Remove all existing rules
       -D
       # Never record sudo invocations
       -A exclude,always -F exe=/usr/bin/sudo

```

## https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#DISABLED_BY_DEFAULTDISABLED BY DEFAULT [top](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html#top_of_page)

```

       On many systems auditd is configured to install an -a never,task
       rule by default. This rule causes every new process to skip all
       audit rule processing. This is usually done to avoid a small
       performance overhead imposed by syscall auditing. If you want to
       use auditd, you need to remove that rule by deleting 10-no-
       audit.rules and adding 10-base-config.rules to the audit rules
       directory.

       If you have defined audit rules that are not matching when they
       should, check auditctl -l to make sure there is no never,task rule
       there.
