```

       This manual is intended for users wishing to understand dpkg's
       command line options and package states in more detail than that
       provided by dpkg --help.

       It should not be used by package maintainers wishing to understand
       how dpkg will install their packages.  The descriptions of what
       dpkg does when installing and removing packages are particularly
       inadequate.

```

## https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html#DESCRIPTIONDESCRIPTION [top](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html#top_of_page)

```

       dpkg is a medium-level tool to install, build, remove and manage
       Debian packages.  The primary and more user-friendly front-end for
       dpkg as a CLI (command-line interface) is apt(8) and as a TUI
       (terminal user interface) is aptitude(8).  dpkg itself is
       controlled entirely via command line parameters, which consist of
       exactly one command and zero or more options.  The
       command-parameter tells dpkg what to do and options control the
       behavior of the command in some way.

       dpkg can also be used as a front-end to [dpkg-deb(1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg-deb.1.html) and
       [dpkg-query(1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg-query.1.html).  The list of supported commands can be found later
       on in the COMMANDS section.  If any such command is encountered
       dpkg just runs dpkg-deb or dpkg-query with the parameters given to
       it, but no specific options are currently passed to them, to use
       any such option the back-ends need to be called directly.

```

## https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html#INFORMATION_ABOUT_PACKAGESINFORMATION ABOUT PACKAGES [top](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html#top_of_page)

```

       dpkg maintains some usable information about available packages.
       The information is divided in three classes: states, selection
       states and flags.  These values are intended to be changed mainly
       with dselect.

   Package states
       not-installed
           The package is not installed on your system.

       config-files
           Only the configuration files or the postrm script and the data
           it needs to remove of the package exist on the system.

       half-installed
           The installation of the package has been started, but not
           completed for some reason.

       unpacked
           The package is unpacked, but not configured.

       half-configured
           The package is unpacked and configuration has been started,
           but not yet completed for some reason.

       triggers-awaited
           The package awaits trigger processing by another package.

       triggers-pending
           The package has been triggered.

       installed
           The package is correctly unpacked and configured.

   Package selection states
       install
           The package is selected for installation.

       hold
           A package marked to be on hold is kept on the same version,
           that is, no automatic new installs, upgrades or removals will
           be performed on them, unless these actions are requested
           explicitly, or are permitted to be done automatically with the
           --force-hold option.

       deinstall
           The package is selected for deinstallation (i.e. we want to
           remove all files, except configuration files).

       purge
           The package is selected to be purged (i.e. we want to remove
           everything from system directories, even configuration files).

       unknown
           The package selection is unknown.  A package that is also in a
           not-installed state, and with an ok flag will be forgotten in
           the next database store.

   Package flags
       ok  A package marked ok is in a known state, but might need
           further processing.

       reinstreq
           A package marked reinstreq is broken and requires
           reinstallation.  These packages cannot be removed, unless
           forced with option --force-remove-reinstreq.

```

## https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html#COMMANDSCOMMANDS [top](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html#top_of_page)

```

       -i, --install package-file...
           Install the package.  If --recursive or -R option is
           specified, package-file must refer to a directory instead.

           Installation consists of the following steps:

           1.  Extract the control files of the new package.

           2.  If another version of the same package was installed
               before the new installation, execute prerm script of the
               old package.

           3.  Run preinst script, if provided by the package.

           4.  Unpack the new files, and at the same time back up the old
               files, so that if something goes wrong, they can be
               restored.

           5.  If another version of the same package was installed
               before the new installation, execute the postrm script of
               the old package.  Note that this script is executed after
               the preinst script of the new package, because new files
               are written at the same time old files are removed.

           6.  Configure the package.  See --configure for detailed
               information about how this is done.

       --unpack package-file...
           Unpack the package, but don't configure it.  If --recursive or
           -R option is specified, package-file must refer to a directory
           instead.

           Will process triggers for Pre-Depends unless --no-triggers has
           been specified.

       --configure package...|-a|--pending
           Configure a package which has been unpacked but not yet
           configured.  If -a or --pending is given instead of package,
           all unpacked but unconfigured packages are configured.

           To reconfigure a package which has already been configured,
           try the dpkg-reconfigure(8) command instead (which is part of
           the debconf project).

           Configuring consists of the following steps:

           1.  Unpack the conffiles, and at the same time back up the old
               conffiles, so that they can be restored if something goes
               wrong.

           2.  Run postinst script, if provided by the package.

           Will process triggers unless --no-triggers has been specified.

       --triggers-only package...|-a|--pending
           Processes only triggers.  All pending triggers will be
           processed.  If package names are supplied only those packages'
           triggers will be processed, exactly once each where necessary.
           Use of this option may leave packages in the improper
           triggers-awaited and triggers-pending states.  This can be
           fixed later by running: dpkg --configure --pending.

           Supported since dpkg 1.14.17.

       -r, --remove package...|-a|--pending
           Remove an installed package.  This removes everything except
           conffiles and other data cleaned up by the postrm script,
           which may avoid having to reconfigure the package if it is
           reinstalled later (conffiles are configuration files that are
           listed in the DEBIAN/conffiles control file).  If there is no
           DEBIAN/conffiles control file nor DEBIAN/postrm script, this
           command is equivalent to calling --purge.  If -a or --pending
           is given instead of a package name, then all packages
           unpacked, but marked to be removed in file
           /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/status, are removed.

           Removing of a package consists of the following steps:

           1.  Run prerm script.

           2.  Remove the installed files.

           3.  Run postrm script.

           Will process triggers unless --no-triggers has been specified.

       -P, --purge package...|-a|--pending
           Purge an installed or already removed package.  This removes
           everything, including conffiles, and anything else cleaned up
           from postrm.  If -a or --pending is given instead of a package
           name, then all packages unpacked or removed, but marked to be
           purged in file /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/status, are purged.

           Note: Some configuration files might be unknown to dpkg
           because they are created and handled separately through the
           configuration scripts.  In that case, dpkg won't remove them
           by itself, but the package's postrm script (which is called by
           dpkg), has to take care of their removal during purge.  Of
           course, this only applies to files in system directories, not
           configuration files written to individual users' home
           directories.

           Purging of a package consists of the following steps:

           1.  Remove the package, if not already removed.  See --remove
               for detailed information about how this is done.

           2.  Run postrm script.

           Will process triggers unless --no-triggers has been specified.

       -V, --verify [package-name...]
           Verifies the integrity of package-name or all packages if
           omitted, by comparing information from the files installed by
           a package with the files metadata information stored in the
           dpkg database.  The origin of the files metadata information
           in the database is the binary packages themselves.  That
           metadata gets collected at package unpack time during the
           installation process.

           Currently the only functional check performed is an md5sum
           verification of the file contents against the stored value in
           the files database.  It will only get checked if the database
           contains the file md5sum.  To check for any missing metadata
           in the database, the --audit command can be used.  This is
           only an integrity check and should not be considered as any
           kind of security verification.

           The output format is selectable with the --verify-format
           option, which by default uses the rpm format, but that might
           change in the future, and as such, programs parsing this
           command output should be explicit about the format they
           expect.

           Supported since dpkg 1.17.2.

       -C, --audit [package-name...]
           Performs database sanity and consistency checks for
           package-name or all packages if omitted (per package checks
           since dpkg 1.17.10).  For example, searches for packages that
           have been installed only partially on your system or that have
           missing, wrong or obsolete control data or files.  dpkg will
           suggest what to do with them to get them fixed.

       --update-avail [Packages-file]
       --merge-avail [Packages-file]
           Update dpkg's and dselect's idea of which packages are
           available.  With the --merge-avail command, old information is
           combined with information from Packages-file.  With the
           --update-avail command, old information is replaced with the
           information in the Packages-file.  The Packages-file
           distributed with Debian is simply named «Packages».  If the
           Packages-file argument is missing or named «-» then it will be
           read from standard input (since dpkg 1.17.7).  dpkg keeps its
           record of available packages in
           /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/available.

           A simpler one-shot command to retrieve and update the
           available file is dselect update.  Note that this file is
           mostly useless if you don't use dselect but an APT-based
           frontend: APT has its own system to keep track of available
           packages.

       -A, --record-avail package-file...
           Update dpkg and dselect's idea of which packages are available
           with information from the package package-file.  If
           --recursive or -R option is specified, package-file must refer
           to a directory instead.

       --forget-old-unavail
           Now obsolete and a no-op as dpkg will automatically forget
           uninstalled unavailable packages, but only those that do not
           contain user information such as package selections.

           Obsolete since dpkg 1.15.4.

       --clear-avail
           Erase the existing information about what packages are
           available.

       --get-selections [package-name-pattern...]
           Get list of package selections, and write it to stdout.
           Without a pattern, non-installed packages with a state that is
           neither deinstall or purge (i.e. those which have been
           previously purged) will not be shown.

       --set-selections
           Set package selections using file read from stdin.  This file
           should be in the format “package state”, where state is one of
           install, hold, deinstall or purge.  Blank lines and comment
           lines beginning with ‘#’ are also permitted.

           The available file needs to be up-to-date for this command to
           be useful, otherwise unknown packages will be ignored with a
           warning.  See the --update-avail and --merge-avail commands
           for more information.

       --clear-selections
           Set the requested state of every non-essential package to
           deinstall.  This is intended to be used immediately before
           --set-selections, to deinstall any packages not in list given
           to --set-selections.

           Supported since dpkg 1.13.18.

       --yet-to-unpack
           Searches for packages selected for installation, but which for
           some reason still haven't been installed.

           Note: This command makes use of both the available file and
           the package selections.

       --predep-package
           Print a single package which is the target of one or more
           relevant pre-dependencies and has itself no unsatisfied
           pre-dependencies.

           If such a package is present, output it as a Packages file
           entry, which can be massaged as appropriate.

           Note: This command makes use of both the available file and
           the package selections.

           Returns 0 when a package is printed, 1 when no suitable
           package is available and 2 on error.

       --add-architecture architecture
           Add architecture to the list of architectures for which
           packages can be installed without using --force-architecture.
           The architecture dpkg is built for (i.e. the output of
           --print-architecture) is always part of that list.

           Supported since dpkg 1.16.2.

       --remove-architecture architecture
           Remove architecture from the list of architectures for which
           packages can be installed without using --force-architecture.
           If the architecture is currently in use in the database then
           the operation will be refused, except if --force-architecture
           is specified.  The architecture dpkg is built for (i.e. the
           output of --print-architecture) can never be removed from that
           list.

           Supported since dpkg 1.16.2.

       --print-architecture
           Print architecture of packages dpkg installs (for example,
           “i386”).

       --print-foreign-architectures
           Print a newline-separated list of the extra architectures dpkg
           is configured to allow packages to be installed for.

           Supported since dpkg 1.16.2.

       --assert-help
           Give help about the --assert-feature options.

           Supported since dpkg 1.21.0.

       --assert-feature
           Asserts that dpkg supports the requested feature.  Returns 0
           if the feature is fully supported, 1 if the feature is known
           but dpkg cannot provide support for it yet, and 2 if the
           feature is unknown.  The current list of assertable features
           is:

           support-predepends
               Supports the Pre-Depends field, since dpkg 1.1.0.

           working-epoch
               Supports epochs in version strings, since dpkg 1.4.0.7.

           long-filenames
               Supports long filenames in [deb(5)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/deb.5.html) archives, since dpkg
               1.4.1.17.

           multi-conrep
               Supports multiple Conflicts and Replaces, since dpkg
               1.4.1.19.

           multi-arch
               Supports multi-arch fields and semantics, since dpkg
               1.16.2.

           versioned-provides
               Supports versioned Provides, since dpkg 1.17.11.

           protected-field
               Supports the Protected field, since dpkg 1.20.1.

       --validate-thing string
           Validate that the thing string has a correct syntax.  Returns
           0 if the string is valid, 1 if the string is invalid but might
           be accepted in lax contexts, and 2 if the string is invalid.
           The current list of validatable things is:

           Supported since dpkg 1.18.16.

           pkgname
               Validates the given package name.

               Supported since dpkg 1.18.16.

           trigname
               Validates the given trigger name.

               Supported since dpkg 1.18.16.

           archname
               Validates the given architecture name.

               Supported since dpkg 1.18.16.

           version
               Validates the given version.

               Supported since dpkg 1.18.16.

       --compare-versions ver1 op ver2
           Compare version numbers, where op is a binary operator.  dpkg
           returns true (0) if the specified condition is satisfied, and
           false (1) otherwise.  There are two groups of operators, which
           differ in how they treat an empty ver1 or ver2.  These treat
           an empty version as earlier than any version: lt le eq ne ge
           gt.  These treat an empty version as later than any version:
           lt-nl le-nl ge-nl gt-nl.  These are provided only for
           compatibility with control file syntax: < << <= = >= >> >.
           The < and > operators are obsolete and should not be used, due
           to confusing semantics.  To illustrate: 0.1 < 0.1 evaluates to
           true.

## https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html#OPTIONSOPTIONS [top](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html#top_of_page)

```

       All options can be specified both on the command line and in the
       dpkg configuration file /usr/local/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg or fragment
       files (with names matching this shell pattern '[0-9a-zA-Z_-]*') on
       the configuration directory /usr/local/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/.  Each
       line in the configuration file is either an option (exactly the
       same as the command line option but without leading hyphens) or a
       comment (if it starts with a ‘#’).

       --abort-after=number
           Change after how many errors dpkg will abort.  The default is
           50.

       -B, --auto-deconfigure
           When a package is removed, there is a possibility that another
           installed package depended on the removed package.  Specifying
           this option will cause automatic deconfiguration of the
           package which depended on the removed package.

       -Doctal, --debug=octal
           Switch debugging on.  octal is formed by bitwise-ORing desired
           values together from the list below (note that these values
           may change in future releases).  -Dh or --debug=help display
           these debugging values.

               Number   Description
                    1   Generally helpful progress information

       --force-things
       --no-force-things, --refuse-things
           Force or refuse (no-force and refuse mean the same thing) to
           do some things.  things is a comma separated list of things
           specified below.  --force-help displays a message describing
           them.  Things marked with (*) are forced by default.

           Warning: These options are mostly intended to be used by
           experts only.  Using them without fully understanding their
           effects may break your whole system.

           all:
             Turns on (or off) all force options.

           downgrade(*):
             Install a package, even if newer version of it is already
             installed.

             Warning: At present dpkg does not do any dependency checking
             on downgrades and therefore will not warn you if the
             downgrade breaks the dependency of some other package.  This
             can have serious side effects, downgrading essential system
             components can even make your whole system unusable.  Use
             with care.

           configure-any:
             Configure also any unpacked but unconfigured packages on
             which the current package depends.

           hold:
             Allow automatic installs, upgrades or removals of packages
             even when marked to be on “hold”.  Note: When these actions
             are requested explicitly, the “hold” package selection state
             always gets ignored.

           remove-reinstreq:
             Remove a package, even if it's broken and marked to require
             reinstallation.  This may, for example, cause parts of the
             package to remain on the system, which will then be
             forgotten by dpkg.

           remove-protected:
             Remove, even if the package is considered protected.
             Protected packages contain mostly important system boot
             infrastructure or are used for custom system-local
             meta-packages.  Removing them might cause the whole system
             to be unable to boot or lose required functionality to
             operate, so use with caution.

             Supported since dpkg 1.20.1.

           remove-essential:
             Remove, even if the package is considered essential.
             Essential packages contain mostly very basic Unix commands,
             required for the packaging system, for the operation of the
             system in general or during boot (although the latter should
             be converted to protected packages instead).  Removing them
             might cause the whole system to stop working, so use with
             caution.

           depends:
             Turn all dependency problems into warnings.  This affects
             the Pre-Depends and Depends fields.

           depends-version:
             Don't care about versions when checking dependencies.  This
             affects the Pre-Depends and Depends fields.

           breaks:
             Install, even if this would break another package.  This
             affects the Breaks field.

             Supported since dpkg 1.14.6.

           conflicts:
             Install, even if it conflicts with another package.  This is
             dangerous, for it will usually cause overwriting of some
             files.  This affects the Conflicts field.

           confmiss:
             Always install the missing conffile without prompting.  This
             is dangerous, since it means not preserving a change
             (removing) made to the file.

           confnew:
             If a conffile has been modified and the version in the
             package did change, always install the new version without
             prompting, unless the --force-confdef is also specified, in
             which case the default action is preferred.

           confold:
             If a conffile has been modified and the version in the
             package did change, always keep the old version without
             prompting, unless the --force-confdef is also specified, in
             which case the default action is preferred.

           confdef:
             If a conffile has been modified and the version in the
             package did change, always choose the default action without
             prompting.  If there is no default action it will stop to
             ask the user unless --force-confnew or --force-confold is
             also given, in which case it will use that to decide the
             final action.

           confask:
             If a conffile has been modified always offer to replace it
             with the version in the package, even if the version in the
             package did not change.  If any of --force-confnew,
             --force-confold, or --force-confdef is also given, it will
             be used to decide the final action.

             Supported since dpkg 1.15.8.

           overwrite:
             Overwrite one package's file with another's file.

           overwrite-dir:
             Overwrite one package's directory with another's file.

           overwrite-diverted:
             Overwrite a diverted file with an undiverted version.

           statoverride-add:
             Overwrite an existing stat override when adding it.

             Supported since dpkg 1.19.5.

           statoverride-remove:
             Ignore a missing stat override when removing it.

             Supported since dpkg 1.19.5.

           security-mac(*):
             Use platform-specific Mandatory Access Controls (MAC) based
             security when installing files into the filesystem.  On
             Linux systems the implementation uses SELinux.

             Supported since dpkg 1.19.5.

           unsafe-io:
             Do not perform safe I/O operations when unpacking.
             Currently this implies not performing file system syncs
             before file renames, which is known to cause substantial
             performance degradation on some file systems, unfortunately
             the ones that require the safe I/O on the first place due to
             their unreliable behaviour causing zero-length files on
             abrupt system crashes.

             Note: For ext4, the main offender, consider using instead
             the mount option nodelalloc, which will fix both the
             performance degradation and the data safety issues, the
             latter by making the file system not produce zero-length
             files on abrupt system crashes with any software not doing
             syncs before atomic renames.

             Warning: Using this option might improve performance at the
             cost of losing data, use with care.

             Supported since dpkg 1.15.8.6.

           script-chrootless:
             Run maintainer scripts without [chroot(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chroot.2.html)ing into instdir
             even if the package does not support this mode of operation.

             Warning: This can destroy your host system, use with extreme
             care.

             Supported since dpkg 1.18.5.

           architecture:
             Process even packages with wrong or no architecture.

           bad-version:
             Process even packages with wrong versions.

             Supported since dpkg 1.16.1.

           bad-path:
             PATH is missing important programs, so problems are likely.

           not-root:
             Try to (de)install things even when not root.

           bad-verify:
             Install a package even if it fails authenticity check.

       --ignore-depends=package,...
           Ignore dependency-checking for specified packages (actually,
           checking is performed, but only warnings about conflicts are
           given, nothing else).  This affects the Pre-Depends, Depends
           and Breaks fields.

       --no-act, --dry-run, --simulate
           Do everything which is supposed to be done, but don't write
           any changes.  This is used to see what would happen with the
           specified command, without actually modifying anything.

           Be sure to give --no-act before the command-parameter, or you
           might end up with undesirable results (e.g. dpkg --purge foo
           --no-act will first purge package “foo” and then try to purge
           package ”--no-act”, even though you probably expected it to
           actually do nothing).

       -R, --recursive
           Recursively handle all regular files matching pattern *.deb
           found at specified directories and all of its subdirectories.
           This can be used with -i, -A, --install, --unpack and
           --record-avail commands.

       -G  Don't install a package if a newer version of the same package
           is already installed.  This is an alias of --refuse-downgrade.

       --admindir=directory
           Set the administrative directory to directory.  This directory
           contains many files that give information about status of
           installed or uninstalled packages, etc.  Defaults to
           «/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg» if DPKG_ADMINDIR has not been set.

       --instdir=directory
           Set the installation directory, which refers to the directory
           where packages are to be installed.  instdir is also the
           directory passed to [chroot(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chroot.2.html) before running package's
           installation scripts, which means that the scripts see instdir
           as a root directory.  Defaults to «/» if DPKG_ROOT has not
           been set (since dpkg 1.21.10).

       --root=directory
           Set the root directory to directory, which sets the
           installation directory to «directory» and the administrative
           directory to «directory/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg» if DPKG_ROOT
           has not been set (since dpkg 1.21.10).

       -O, --selected-only
           Only process the packages that are selected for installation.
           The actual marking is done with dselect or by dpkg, when it
           handles packages.  For example, when a package is removed, it
           will be marked selected for deinstallation.

       -E, --skip-same-version
           Don't install the package if the same version and architecture
           of the package is already installed.

           Since dpkg 1.21.10, the architecture is also taken into
           account, which makes it possible to cross-grade packages or
           install additional co-installable instances with the same
           version, but different architecture.

       --pre-invoke=command
       --post-invoke=command
           Set an invoke hook command to be run via “sh -c” before or
           after the dpkg run for the unpack, configure, install,
           triggers-only, remove and purge actions (since dpkg 1.15.4),
           and add-architecture and remove-architecture actions (since
           dpkg 1.17.19).  This option can be specified multiple times.
           The order the options are specified is preserved, with the
           ones from the configuration files taking precedence.  The
           environment variable DPKG_HOOK_ACTION is set for the hooks to
           the current dpkg action.

           The invoke hooks are not executed when --no-act is specified,
           or when running as non-root without --force-not-root.

           Note: Front-ends might call dpkg several times per invocation,
           which might run the hooks more times than expected.

           Supported since dpkg 1.15.4.

       --path-exclude=glob-pattern
       --path-include=glob-pattern
           Set glob-pattern as a path filter, either by excluding or
           re-including previously excluded paths matching the specified
           patterns during install.

           Warning: Take into account that depending on the excluded
           paths you might completely break your system, use with
           caution.

           The glob patterns use the same wildcards used in the shell,
           were ‘*’ matches any sequence of characters, including the
           empty string and also ‘/’.  For example, «/usr/*/READ*»
           matches «/usr/share/doc/package/README».  As usual, ‘?’
           matches any single character (again, including ‘/’).  And ‘[’
           starts a character class, which can contain a list of
           characters, ranges and complementations.  See [glob(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html) for
           detailed information about globbing.  Note: The current
           implementation might re-include more directories and symlinks
           than needed, in particular when there is a more specific
           re-inclusion, to be on the safe side and avoid possible unpack
           failures; future work might fix this.

           This can be used to remove all paths except some particular
           ones; a typical case is:

            --path-exclude=/usr/share/doc/*
            --path-include=/usr/share/doc/*/copyright

           to remove all documentation files except the copyright files.

           These two options can be specified multiple times, and
           interleaved with each other.  Both are processed in the given
           order, with the last rule that matches a file name making the
           decision.

           The filters are applied when unpacking the binary packages,
           and as such only have knowledge of the type of object
           currently being filtered (e.g. a normal file or a directory)
           and have not visibility of what objects will come next.
           Because these filters have side effects (in contrast to
           [find(1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html) filters), excluding an exact pathname that happens to
           be a directory object like /usr/share/doc will not have the
           desired result, and only that pathname will be excluded (which
           could be automatically reincluded if the code sees the need).
           Any subsequent files contained within that directory will fail
           to unpack.

           Hint: make sure the globs are not expanded by your shell.

           Supported since dpkg 1.15.8.

       --verify-format format-name
           Sets the output format for the --verify command.

           The only currently supported output format is rpm, which
           consists of a line for every path that failed any check.
           These lines have the following format:

            missing   [c] pathname [(error-message)]
            ?M5?????? [c] pathname

           The first 9 characters are used to report the checks result,
           either a literal missing when the file is not present or its
           metadata cannot be fetched, or one of the following special
           characters that report the result for each check:

           ‘?’ Implies the check could not be done (lack of support, file
               permissions, etc).

           ‘.’ Implies the check passed.

           ‘A-Za-z0-9’
               Implies a specific check failed.  The following positions
               and alphanumeric characters are currently supported:

               1 ‘?’
                   These checks are currently not supported, will always
                   be ‘?’.

               2 ‘M’
                   The file mode check failed.  Because pathname metadata
                   is currently not tracked, this check can only be
                   partially emulated via a very simple heuristic for
                   pathnames that have a known digest, which implies they
                   should be regular files, where the check will fail if
                   the pathname is not a regular file on the filesystem.
                   This check will currently never succeed as it does not
                   have enough information available.

                   Supported since dpkg 1.21.0.

               3 ‘5’
                   The digest check failed, which means the file contents
                   have changed.  This is only an integrity check and
                   should not be considered as any kind of security
                   verification.

               4-9 ‘?’
                   These checks are currently not supported, will always
                   be ‘?’.

           The line is followed by a space and an attribute character.
           The following attribute character is supported:

           ‘c’ The pathname is a conffile.

           Finally followed by another space and the pathname.

           In case the entry was of the missing type, and the file was
           not actually present on the filesystem, then the line is
           followed by a space and the error message enclosed within
           parenthesis.

           Supported since dpkg 1.17.2.

       --status-fd n
           Send machine-readable package status and progress information
           to file descriptor n.  This option can be specified multiple
           times.  The information is generally one record per line, in
           one of the following forms:

           status: package: status
               Package status changed; status is as in the status file.

           status: package : error : extended-error-message
               An error occurred.  Any possible newlines in
               extended-error-message will be converted to spaces before
               output.

           status: file : conffile-prompt : 'real-old' 'real-new'
           useredited distedited
               User is being asked a conffile question.

           processing: stage: package
               Sent just before a processing stage starts.  stage is one
               of upgrade, install (both sent before unpacking),
               configure, trigproc, disappear, remove, purge.

       --status-logger=command
           Send machine-readable package status and progress information
           to the shell command's standard input, to be run via “sh -c”.
           This option can be specified multiple times.  The output
           format used is the same as in --status-fd.

           The status loggers are not executed when --no-act is
           specified, or when running as non-root without
           --force-not-root.

           Supported since dpkg 1.16.0.

       --log=filename
           Log status change updates and actions to filename, instead of
           the default /usr/local/var/log/dpkg.log.  If this option is
           given multiple times, the last filename is used.  Log messages
           are of the form:

           YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS startup type command
               For each dpkg invocation where type is archives (with a
               command of unpack or install) or packages (with a command
               of configure, triggers-only, remove or purge).

           YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS status state pkg installed-version
               For status change updates.

           YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS action pkg installed-version
           available-version
               For actions where action is one of install, upgrade,
               configure, trigproc, disappear, remove or purge.

           YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS conffile filename decision
               For conffile changes where decision is either install or
               keep.

       --robot
           Use a machine-readable output format.  This provides an
           interface for programs that need to parse the output of some
           of the commands that do not otherwise emit a machine-readable
           output format.  No localization will be used, and the output
           will be modified to make it easier to parse.

           The only currently supported command is --version.

       --no-pager
           Disables the use of any pager when showing information.

           Supported since dpkg 1.19.2.

       --no-debsig
           Do not try to verify package signatures.

       --no-triggers
           Do not run any triggers in this run, but activations will
           still be recorded.  If used with --configure package or
           --triggers-only package then the named package postinst will
           still be run even if only a triggers run is needed.  Use of
           this option may leave packages in the improper
           triggers-awaited and triggers-pending states.  This can be
           fixed later by running: dpkg --configure --pending.

           Supported since dpkg 1.14.17.

       --triggers
           Cancels a previous --no-triggers.

           Supported since dpkg 1.14.17.

```

   External environment
       PATH
           This variable is expected to be defined in the environment and
           point to the system paths where several required programs are
           to be found.  If it's not set or the programs are not found,
           dpkg will abort.

       HOME
           If set, dpkg will use it as the directory from which to read
           the user specific configuration file.

       TMPDIR
           If set, dpkg will use it as the directory in which to create
           temporary files and directories.

       SHELL
           The program dpkg will execute when starting a new interactive
           shell, or when spawning a command via a shell.

       PAGER
       DPKG_PAGER
           The program dpkg will execute when running a pager, which will
           be executed with «$SHELL -c», for example when displaying the
           conffile differences.  If SHELL is not set, «sh» will be used
           instead.

           When non-empty DPKG_PAGER overrides the PAGER environment
           variable.  If none of the programs pointed by DPKG_PAGER or
           PAGER are present, the following programs will be tried in
           order (since dpkg 1.22.12): the default pager less, then
           [less(1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/less.1.html), [more(1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/more.1.html), and finally [cat(1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html).

           The cat value is special, and it is equivalent to disabling
           paging entirely.

           Support for DPKG_PAGER since dpkg 1.19.2.

       DPKG_COLORS
           Sets the color mode.  The currently accepted values are: auto
           (default), always and never.

           Supported since dpkg 1.18.5.

       DPKG_NLS
           If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
           Language Support, also known as internationalization (or i18n)
           support.  The accepted values are: 0 and 1 (default).

           Supported since dpkg 1.22.7.

       DPKG_DEBUG
           Sets the debug mask from an octal value.  The currently
           accepted flags are described in the --debug option.

           Supported since dpkg 1.21.10.

       DPKG_FORCE
           Sets the force flags.  When this variable is present, no
           built-in force defaults will be applied.  If the variable is
           present but empty, all force flags will be disabled.

           Supported since dpkg 1.19.5.

       DPKG_ROOT
           If set and the --instdir or --root options have not been
           specified, it will be used as the filesystem root directory.

           Supported since dpkg 1.21.10.

       DPKG_ADMINDIR
           If set and the --admindir or --root options have not been
           specified, it will be used as the dpkg administrative
           directory.

           Supported since dpkg 1.20.0.

       DPKG_FRONTEND_LOCKED
           Set by a package manager frontend to notify dpkg that it
           should not acquire the frontend lock.

           Supported since dpkg 1.19.1.

       DPKG_PATH_PASSWD
           Sets the pathname for the system passwd file.  This path is
           relative to the --root directory.  The default is /etc/passwd.

           Supported since dpkg 1.22.16.

       DPKG_PATH_GROUP
           Sets the pathname for the system group file.  This path is
           relative to the --root directory.  The default is /etc/group.

           Supported since dpkg 1.22.16.

   Internal environment
       LESS
           Defined by dpkg to “-FRSXMQ”, if not already set, when
           spawning a pager.  To change the default behavior, this
           variable can be preset to some other value including an empty
           string, or the PAGER or DPKG_PAGER variables can be set to
           disable specific options with «-+», for example
           DPKG_PAGER="less -+F".

           Supported since dpkg 1.19.2.

       DPKG_ROOT
           Defined by dpkg on the maintainer script environment to
           indicate which installation to act on.  The value is intended
           to be prepended to any path maintainer scripts operate on.
           During normal operation, this variable is empty.  When
           installing packages into a different instdir, dpkg normally
           invokes maintainer scripts using [chroot(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chroot.2.html) and leaves this
           variable empty, but if --force-script-chrootless is specified
           then the [chroot(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chroot.2.html) call is skipped and this variable is set to
           instdir (which will be non-empty).

           Supported since dpkg 1.18.5.

       DPKG_ADMINDIR
           Defined by dpkg on the maintainer script environment to
           indicate the dpkg administrative directory to use.  This
           variable is always set to the current --admindir value.

           Supported since dpkg 1.16.0.

       DPKG_FORCE
           Defined by dpkg on the subprocesses environment to all the
           currently enabled force option names separated by commas.

           Supported since dpkg 1.19.5.

       DPKG_SHELL_REASON
           Defined by dpkg on the shell spawned on the conffile prompt to
           examine the situation.  Current valid value: conffile-prompt.

           Supported since dpkg 1.15.6.

       DPKG_CONFFILE_OLD
           Defined by dpkg on the shell spawned on the conffile prompt to
           examine the situation.  Contains the path to the old conffile.

           Supported since dpkg 1.15.6.

       DPKG_CONFFILE_NEW
           Defined by dpkg on the shell spawned on the conffile prompt to
           examine the situation.  Contains the path to the new conffile.

           Supported since dpkg 1.15.6.

       DPKG_HOOK_ACTION
           Defined by dpkg on the shell spawned when executing a hook
           action.  Contains the current dpkg action.

           Supported since dpkg 1.15.4.

       DPKG_RUNNING_VERSION
           Defined by dpkg on the maintainer script environment to the
           version of the currently running dpkg instance.

           Supported since dpkg 1.14.17.

       DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE
           Defined by dpkg on the maintainer script environment to the
           (non-arch-qualified) package name being handled.

           Supported since dpkg 1.14.17.

       DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE_REFCOUNT
           Defined by dpkg on the maintainer script environment to the
           package reference count, i.e. the number of package instances
           with a state greater than not-installed.

           Supported since dpkg 1.17.2.

       DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_ARCH
           Defined by dpkg on the maintainer script environment to the
           architecture the package got built for.

           Supported since dpkg 1.15.4.

       DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_NAME
           Defined by dpkg on the maintainer script environment to the
           name of the script running, one of preinst, postinst, prerm or
           postrm.

           Supported since dpkg 1.15.7.

       DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_DEBUG
           Defined by dpkg on the maintainer script environment to a
           value (‘0’ or ‘1’) noting whether debugging has been requested
           (with the --debug option) for the maintainer scripts.

           Supported since dpkg 1.18.4.

       /usr/local/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/[0-9a-zA-Z_-]*
           Configuration fragment files.

           Supported since dpkg 1.15.4.

       /usr/local/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg
           Configuration file with default options.

           Default log file (see /usr/local/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg and option
           --log).

       The other files listed below are in their default directories, see
       option --admindir to see how to change locations of these files.

       /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/available
           List of available packages.

       /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/status
           Statuses of available packages.  This file contains
           information about whether a package is marked for removing or
           not, whether it is installed or not, etc.  See section
           "INFORMATION ABOUT PACKAGES" for more info.

           The status file is backed up daily in /usr/local/var/backups.
           It can be useful if it's lost or corrupted due to filesystems
           troubles.

       The format and contents of a binary package are described in
       [deb(5)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/deb.5.html).

   Filesystem filenames
       During unpacking and configuration dpkg uses various filenames for
       backup and rollback purposes.  The following is a simplified
       explanation of how these filenames get used during package
       installation.

       *.dpkg-new
           During unpack, dpkg extracts new filesystem objects into
           pathname.dpkg-new (except for existing directories or symlinks
           to directories which get skipped), once that is done and after
           having performed backups of the old objects, the objects get
           renamed to pathname.

       *.dpkg-tmp
           During unpack, dpkg makes backups of the old filesystem
           objects into pathname.dpkg-tmp after extracting the new
           objects.  These backups are performed as either a rename for
           directories (but only if they switch file type), a new symlink
           copy for symlinks, or a hard link for any other filesystem
           object, except for conffiles which get no backups because they
           are processed at a later stage.

           In case of needing to rollback, these backups get used to
           restore the previous contents of the objects.  These get
           removed automatically after the installation is complete.

       *.dpkg-old
           During configuration, when installing a new version, dpkg can
           make a backup of the previous modified conffile into
           pathname.dpkg-old.

       *.dpkg-dist
           During configuration, when keeping the old version, dpkg can
           make a backup of the new unmodified conffile into
           pathname.dpkg-dist.

## https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html#SECURITYSECURITY [top](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html#top_of_page)

```

       Any operation that needs write access to the database or the
       filesystem is considered a privileged operation that might allow
       root escalation.  These operations must never be delegated to an
       untrusted user or be done on untrusted packages, as that might
       allow root access to the system.

       Some operations (such as package verification) might need root
       privileges to be able to access files on the filesystem that would
       otherwise be inaccessible due to restricted permissions, but
       should otherwise work normally and produce appropriate messages in
       those cases.

       Query operations should never require root, and delegating their
       execution to unprivileged users via some gain-root command can
       have security implications (such as privilege escalation), for
       example when a pager is automatically invoked by the tool.

       See also the SECURITY section of the [dpkg-deb(1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg-deb.1.html) and [dpkg-split(1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg-split.1.html)

       To list installed packages related to the editor vi(1) (note that
       dpkg-query does not load the available file anymore by default,
       and the dpkg-query --load-avail option should be used instead for
       that):

        dpkg -l '*vi*'

       To see the entries in /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/available of two
       packages:

        dpkg --print-avail | less

       To remove an installed neovim package:

        dpkg -r neovim

       To install a package, you first need to find it in an archive or
       media disc.  When using an archive based on a pool structure,
       knowing the archive area and the name of the package is enough to
       infer the pathname:

        dpkg -i /media/bdrom/pool/main/v/vim/vim_9.0.2018-1_amd64.deb

       To make a local copy of the package selection states:

        dpkg --get-selections >myselections

       You might transfer this file to another computer, and after having
       updated the available file there with your package manager
       frontend of choice (see
       <https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/FAQ#set-selections> for more
       details), for example:

        apt-cache dumpavail | dpkg --merge-avail

       you can install it with:

        dpkg --clear-selections
        dpkg --set-selections <myselections

       Note that this will not actually install or remove anything, but
       just set the selection state on the requested packages.  You will
       need some other application to actually download and install the
       requested packages.  For example, run apt-get dselect-upgrade.

       Ordinarily, you will find that [dselect(1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dselect.1.html) provides a more
       convenient way to modify the package selection states.
