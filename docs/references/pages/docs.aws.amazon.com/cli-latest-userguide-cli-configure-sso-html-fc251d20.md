# Configuring IAM Identity Center authentication with the AWS CLI

This topic provides instructions on how to configure the AWS CLI with AWS IAM Identity Center (IAM Identity Center) to retrieve credentials to run AWS CLI commands. There are primarily two ways to authenticate users with IAM Identity Center to get credentials to run AWS CLI commands through the config file:

-

(Recommended) SSO token provider configuration.

-

Legacy non-refreshable configuration.

For information on using bearer auth, which uses no account ID and role, see [Setting up to use the AWS CLI with CodeCatalyst](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/set-up-cli.html) in the Amazon CodeCatalyst User Guide.

###### Note

For a guided process of using IAM Identity Center with AWS CLI commands, see [Tutorial: Using IAM Identity Center to run Amazon S3 commands in the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso-tutorial.html).

## Prerequisites

-

Install the AWS CLI. For more information, see [Installing or updating to the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

-

You must first have access to SSO authentication within IAM Identity Center. Choose one of the following methods to access your AWS credentials.

Follow the instructions in [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) in the AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide. This process activates IAM Identity Center, creates an administrative user, and adds an appropriate least-privilege permission set.

###### Note

Create a permission set that applies least-privilege permissions. We recommend using the predefined PowerUserAccess permission set, unless your employer has created a custom permission set for this purpose.

Exit the portal and sign in again to see your AWS accounts, programmatic access details, and options for Administrator or PowerUserAccess. Select PowerUserAccess when working with the SDK.

Sign in to AWS through your identity provider’s portal. If your Cloud Administrator has granted you PowerUserAccess (developer) permissions, you see the AWS accounts that you have access to and your permission set. Next to the name of your permission set, you see options to access the accounts manually or programmatically using that permission set.

Custom implementations might result in different experiences, such as different permission set names. If you're not sure which permission set to use, contact your IT team for help.

Sign in to AWS through your AWS access portal. If your Cloud Administrator has granted you PowerUserAccess (developer) permissions, you see the AWS accounts that you have access to and your permission set. Next to the name of your permission set, you see options to access the accounts manually or programmatically using that permission set.

Contact your IT team for help.

After gaining access to IAM Identity Center, gather your IAM Identity Center information by performing the following:

-

Gather your SSO Start URL and SSO Region values that you need to run aws configure sso

-

In your AWS access portal, select the permission set you use for development, and select the Access keys link.

-

In the Get credentials dialog box, choose the tab that matches your operating system.

-

Choose the IAM Identity Center credentials method to get the SSO Start URL and SSO Region values.

-

Alternatively, starting with version 2.22.0, you can use the Issuer URL instead of the Start URL. The Issuer URL is located in the AWS IAM Identity Center console in one of the following locations:

-

On the Dashboard page, the Issuer URL is in the settings summary.

-

On the Settings page, the Issuer URL is in the Identity source settings.

-

For information on which scopes value to register, see [OAuth 2.0 Access scopes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/customermanagedapps-saml2-oauth2.html#oidc-concept) in the IAM Identity Center User Guide.

## Configure your profile with the aws configure sso wizard

###### To configure an IAM Identity Center profile for your AWS CLI:

-

In your preferred terminal, run the aws configure sso command.

(Recommended) IAM Identity Center

Create a session name, provide your IAM Identity Center start URL or the issuer URL, the AWS Region that hosts the IAM Identity Center directory, and the registration scope.

```

$ aws configure sso
SSO session name (Recommended): my-sso
SSO start URL [None]: https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start
SSO region [None]: us-east-1
SSO registration scopes [None]: sso:account:access
```

For dual-stack support, use the dual-stack SSO start URL:

```

$ aws configure sso
SSO session name (Recommended): my-sso
SSO start URL [None]: https://ssoins-1234567890abcdef.portal.us-east-1.app.aws
SSO region [None]: us-east-1
SSO registration scopes [None]: sso:account:access
```

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) authorization is used by default for the AWS CLI starting with version 2.22.0 and must be used on devices with a browser. To continue to use Device authorization, append the --use-device-code option.

```

$ aws configure sso --use-device-code
```

Legacy IAM Identity Center

Skip the session name and provide your IAM Identity Center start URL and the AWS Region that hosts the Identity Center directory.

```

$ aws configure sso
SSO session name (Recommended):
SSO start URL [None]: https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start
SSO region [None]:us-east-1
```

For dual-stack support:

```

$ aws configure sso
SSO session name (Recommended):
SSO start URL [None]: https://ssoins-1234567890abcdef.portal.us-east-1.app.aws
SSO region [None]:us-east-1
```

-

The AWS CLI attempts to open your default browser for the sign in process of your IAM Identity Center account. This process might prompt you to allow the AWS CLI access to your data. On the approval screen, the client name begins with botocore-client-, named for botocore, a Python library that the AWS CLI uses.

-

If the AWS CLI cannot open the browser, instructions to manually start the sign in process are displayed based on the type of authorization you are using.

PKCE authorization

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) authorization is used by default for the AWS CLI starting with version 2.22.0. The URL displayed is a unique URL starting with:

-

IPv4: https://oidc.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/authorize

-

Dual-stack: https://oidc.us-east-1.api.aws/authorize

PKCE authorization URLs must be opened on the same device you're signing in to and must be used for a device with a browser.

```

Attempting to automatically open the SSO authorization page in your
default browser.
If the browser does not open or you wish to use a different device to
authorize the request, open the following URL:

https://oidc.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/authorize?<abbreviated>
```

Device authorization

The OAuth 2.0 device authorization is used by the AWS CLI for versions older than 2.22.0. You can enable this method on newer versions by using the --use-device-code option.

Device authorization URLs do not need to be opened on the same device you're signing in to and can be used for a device with or without a browser. The endpoint format depends on your configuration:

-

IPv4: https://device.sso.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/

-

Dual-stack: https://device.sso.us-west-2.api.aws/

```

If the browser does not open or you wish to use a different device to
authorize this request, open the following URL:
https://device.sso.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/

Then enter the code:
QCFK-N451
```

[Show moreShow less](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html#)

-

Select the AWS account to use from the displayed list. If you are authorized to use only one account, the AWS CLI automatically selects that account and skips the prompt.

```

There are 2 AWS accounts available to you.
> DeveloperAccount, developer-account-admin@example.com (123456789011)
  ProductionAccount, production-account-admin@example.com (123456789022)
```

-

Select the IAM role to use from the displayed list. If there is only one role available, the AWS CLI automatically selects that role and skips the prompt.

```

Using the account ID 123456789011
There are 2 roles available to you.
> ReadOnly
  FullAccess
```

-

Specify the [default output format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-output), the [default AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-region) to send commands to, and a [name for the profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html). If you specify default as the profile name, this profile becomes the default profile used. In the following example, the user enters a default Region, default output format, and the name of the profile.

```

Default client Region [None]: us-west-2<ENTER>
CLI default output format (json if not specified) [None]: json<ENTER>
Profile name [123456789011_ReadOnly]: my-dev-profile<ENTER>
```

-

A final message describes the completed profile configuration. You can now use this profile to request credentials. Use the aws sso login command to request and retrieve the credentials needed to run commands. For instructions, see [Sign in to an IAM Identity Center session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html#cli-configure-sso-login).

These steps result in creating the sso-session section and named profile in the config file that looks like the following:

IAM Identity Center

```

[profile my-dev-profile]
sso_session = my-sso
sso_account_id = 123456789011
sso_role_name = readOnly
region = us-west-2
output = json

[sso-session my-sso]
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_start_url = https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
```

For dual-stack support:

```

[profile my-dev-profile]
sso_session = my-sso
sso_account_id = 123456789011
sso_role_name = readOnly
region = us-west-2
output = json

[sso-session my-sso]
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_start_url = https://ssoins-1234567890abcdef.portal.us-east-1.app.aws
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
```

For a vanity URL, the AWS CLI writes sso_region automatically after the first successful login. The AWS CLI derives the Region from the redirect:

```

[profile my-dev-profile]
sso_session = my-sso
sso_account_id = 123456789011
sso_role_name = readOnly
region = us-west-2
output = json

[sso-session my-sso]
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_start_url = https://aws.mycompany.com
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
```

Legacy IAM Identity Center

```

[profile my-dev-profile]
sso_start_url = https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_account_id = 123456789011
sso_role_name = readOnly
region = us-west-2
output = json
```

For dual-stack support:

```

[profile my-dev-profile]
sso_start_url = https://ssoins-1234567890abcdef.portal.us-east-1.app.aws
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_account_id = 123456789011
sso_role_name = readOnly
region = us-west-2
output = json
```

## Configure only your sso-session section with aws configure sso-session wizard

###### Note

This configuration is not compatible with the legacy IAM Identity Center.

The aws configure sso-session command updates the sso-session sections in the ~/.aws/config file. Run the aws configure sso-session command and provide your IAM Identity Center start URL or issuer URL and the AWS Region that hosts the IAM Identity Center directory.

```

$ aws configure sso-session
SSO session name: my-sso
SSO start URL [None]: https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start
SSO region [None]: us-east-1
SSO registration scopes [None]: sso:account:access
```

For dual-stack support, use the dual-stack SSO start URL:

```

$ aws configure sso-session
SSO session name: my-sso
SSO start URL [None]: https://ssoins-1234567890abcdef.portal.us-east-1.app.aws
SSO region [None]: us-east-1
SSO registration scopes [None]: sso:account:access
```

## Manual configuration using the config file

IAM Identity Center configuration information is stored in the config file and can be edited using a text editor. To manually add IAM Identity Center support to a named profile, you must add keys and values to the config file.

The sso-session section of the config file is used to group configuration variables for acquiring SSO access tokens, which can then be used to acquire AWS credentials. The following settings are used:

-

(Required) [sso_start_url](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_start_url)

-

(Required) [sso_region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_region)

-

[sso_account_id](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_account_id)

-

[sso_role_name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_role_name)

-

[sso_registration_scopes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_registration_scopes)

You define an sso-session section and associate it to a profile. The sso_region and sso_start_url settings must be set within the sso-session section. Typically, sso_account_id and sso_role_name must be set in the profile section so that the SDK can request SSO credentials.

The following example configures the SDK to request SSO credentials and supports automated token refresh:

```

[profile dev]
sso_session = my-sso
sso_account_id = 111122223333
sso_role_name = SampleRole

[sso-session my-sso]
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_start_url = https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start
```

For dual-stack support, use the dual-stack SSO start URL format:

```

[profile dev]
sso_session = my-sso
sso_account_id = 111122223333
sso_role_name = SampleRole

[sso-session my-sso]
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_start_url = https://ssoins-1234567890abcdef.portal.us-east-1.app.aws
```

This also allows sso-session configurations to be reused across multiple profiles:

```

[profile dev]
sso_session = my-sso
sso_account_id = 111122223333
sso_role_name = SampleRole

[profile prod]
sso_session = my-sso
sso_account_id = 111122223333
sso_role_name = SampleRole2

[sso-session my-sso]
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_start_url = https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start
```

For dual-stack support, use the dual-stack SSO start URL format:

```

[profile dev]
sso_session = my-sso
sso_account_id = 111122223333
sso_role_name = SampleRole

[profile prod]
sso_session = my-sso
sso_account_id = 111122223333
sso_role_name = SampleRole2

[sso-session my-sso]
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_start_url = https://ssoins-1234567890abcdef.portal.us-east-1.app.aws
```

However, sso_account_id and sso_role_name aren't required for all scenarios of SSO token configuration. If your application only uses AWS services that support bearer authentication, then traditional AWS credentials are not needed. Bearer authentication is an HTTP authentication scheme that uses security tokens called bearer tokens. In this scenario, sso_account_id and sso_role_name aren't required. See the individual guide for your AWS service to determine if it supports bearer token authorization.

Additionally, registration scopes can be configured as part of a sso-session. Scope is a mechanism in OAuth 2.0 to limit an application's access to a user's account. An application can request one or more scopes, and the access token issued to the application will be limited to the scopes granted. These scopes define the permissions requested to be authorized for the registered OIDC client and access tokens retrieved by the client. The following example sets sso_registration_scopes to provide access for listing accounts/roles:

```

[sso-session my-sso]
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_start_url = https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
```

For dual-stack support:

```

[sso-session my-sso]
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_start_url = https://ssoins-1234567890abcdef.portal.us-east-1.app.aws
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
```

The authentication token is cached to disk under the sso/cache directory with a filename based on the session name.

###### Note

Automated token refresh isn't supported using the legacy non-refreshable configuration. We recommend using the SSO token configuration.

To manually add IAM Identity Center support to a named profile, you must add the following keys and values to the profile definition in the config file.

-

[sso_start_url](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_start_url)

-

[sso_region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_region)

-

[sso_account_id](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_account_id)

-

[sso_role_name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_role_name)

You can include any other keys and values that are valid in the .aws/config file. The following example is an IAM Identity Center profile:

```

[profile my-sso-profile]
sso_start_url = https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = us-west-2
sso_account_id = 111122223333
sso_role_name = SSOReadOnlyRole
region = us-west-2
output = json
```

For dual-stack support:

```

[profile my-sso-profile]
sso_start_url = https://ssoins-1234567890abcdef.portal.us-east-1.app.aws
sso_region = us-west-2
sso_account_id = 111122223333
sso_role_name = SSOReadOnlyRole
region = us-west-2
output = json
```

To run commands, you must first [Sign in to an IAM Identity Center session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html#cli-configure-sso-login) to request and retrieve your temporary credentials.

For more information on the config and credentials files, see [Configuration and credential file settings in the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

## Sign in to an IAM Identity Center session

###### Note

The sign in process might prompt you to allow the AWS CLI access to your data. On the approval screen, the client name begins with botocore-client-, named for botocore, a Python library that the AWS CLI uses.

To retrieve and cache a set of IAM Identity Center credentials, run the following command for the AWS CLI to open your default browser and verify your IAM Identity Center log in.

```

$ aws sso login --profile my-dev-profile
SSO authorization page has automatically been opened in your default browser.
Follow the instructions in the browser to complete this authorization request.
Successfully logged into Start URL: https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start
```

Your IAM Identity Center session credentials are cached and the AWS CLI uses them to securely retrieve AWS credentials for the IAM role specified in the profile.

If the AWS CLI cannot automatically open your browser, instructions to manually start the sign in process are displayed based on the type of authorization you are using.

PKCE authorization

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) authorization is used by default for the AWS CLI starting with version 2.22.0. The URL displayed is a unique URL starting with:

-

IPv4: https://oidc.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/authorize

-

Dual-stack: https://oidc.us-east-1.api.aws/authorize

PKCE authorization URLs must be opened on the same device you're signing in to and must be used for a device with a browser.

```

Attempting to automatically open the SSO authorization page in your
default browser.
If the browser does not open or you wish to use a different device to
authorize the request, open the following URL:

https://oidc.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/authorize?<abbreviated>
```

Device authorization

The OAuth 2.0 device authorization is used by the AWS CLI for versions older than 2.22.0. You can enable this method on newer versions by using the --use-device-code option.

Device authorization URLs do not need to be opened on the same device you're signing in to and can be used for a device with or without a browser.

```

If the browser does not open or you wish to use a different device to
authorize this request, open the following URL:
https://device.sso.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/

Then enter the code:
QCFK-N451
```

You can also specify which sso-session profile to use when logging in using the --sso-session parameter of the aws sso login command. The sso-session option is not available for legacy IAM Identity Center.

```

$ aws sso login --sso-session my-dev-session
```

Starting with version 2.22.0, PKCE authorization is the default. To use device authorization for signing in, add the --use-device-code option.

```

$ aws sso login --profile my-dev-profile --use-device-code
```

The authentication token is cached to disk under the ~/.aws/sso/cache directory with a filename based on the sso_start_url.

## Run a command with your IAM Identity Center profile

Once logged in, you can use your credentials to invoke AWS CLI commands with the associated named profile. The following example shows a command using a profile:

```

$ aws sts get-caller-identity --profile my-dev-profile
```

As long as you are signed in to IAM Identity Center and those cached credentials are not expired, the AWS CLI automatically renews expired AWS credentials when needed. However, if your IAM Identity Center credentials expire, you must explicitly renew them by logging in to your IAM Identity Center account again.

## Sign out of your IAM Identity Center sessions

When you are done using your IAM Identity Center profile, you can let your credentials expire or run the following command to delete your cached credentials.

```

$ aws sso logout
Successfully signed out of all SSO profiles.
```
