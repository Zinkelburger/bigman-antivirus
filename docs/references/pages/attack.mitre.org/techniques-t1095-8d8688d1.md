#  Non-Application Layer Protocol

Adversaries may use an OSI non-application layer protocol for communication between host and C2 server or among infected hosts within a network. The list of possible protocols is extensive.[[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_network_protocols_%28OSI_model%29) Specific examples include use of network layer protocols, such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), transport layer protocols, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), session layer protocols, such as Socket Secure (SOCKS), as well as redirected/tunneled protocols, such as Serial over LAN (SOL).

ICMP communication between hosts is one example.[[2]](https://blogs.cisco.com/security/evolution-of-attacks-on-cisco-ios-devices) Because ICMP is part of the Internet Protocol Suite, it is required to be implemented by all IP-compatible hosts.[[3]](http://support.microsoft.com/KB/170292) However, it is not as commonly monitored as other Internet Protocols such as TCP or UDP and may be used by adversaries to hide communications.

In ESXi environments, adversaries may leverage the Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) for communication between guest virtual machines and the ESXi host. This traffic is similar to client-server communications on traditional network sockets but is localized to the physical machine running the ESXi host, meaning it does not traverse external networks (routers, switches). This results in communications that are invisible to external monitoring and standard networking tools like tcpdump, netstat, nmap, and Wireshark. By adding a VMCI backdoor to a compromised ESXi host, adversaries may persistently regain access from any guest VM to the compromised ESXi host’s backdoor, regardless of network segmentation or firewall rules in place.[[4]](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/vmware-esxi-zero-day-bypass/)

## Mitigations

| ID  | Mitigation  | Description

|  [M1047](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1047)   |  [Audit](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1047)   |

Periodically investigate ESXi hosts for open VMCI ports. Running the lsof -A command and inspecting results with a type of SOCKET_VMCI will reveal processes that have open VMCI ports.[[121]](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/vmware-detection-containment-hardening)

|  [M1037](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1037)   |  [Filter Network Traffic](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1037)   |

Filter network traffic to prevent use of protocols across the network boundary that are unnecessary. If VMCI is not required in ESXi environments, consider restricting guest virtual machines from accessing VMCI services.[[122]](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/7-0/vsphere-virtual-machine-administration-guide-7-0/configuring-virtual-machine-hardwarevm-admin/virtual-machine-network-configurationvm-admin/serial-port-configurationvm-admin/configure-the-virtual-machine-communication-interface-firewallvm-admin.html)

|  [M1031](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1031)   |  [Network Intrusion Prevention](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1031)   |

Network intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.

|  [M1030](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1030)   |  [Network Segmentation](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1030)   |

Properly configure firewalls and proxies to limit outgoing traffic to only necessary ports and through proper network gateway systems. Also ensure hosts are only provisioned to communicate over authorized interfaces.

## Detection Strategy

| ID  | Name  | Analytic ID  | Analytic Description

|  [DET0457](https://attack.mitre.org/detectionstrategies/DET0457)   |  [Detection of Non-Application Layer Protocols for C2](https://attack.mitre.org/detectionstrategies/DET0457)   |  [AN1254](https://attack.mitre.org/detectionstrategies/DET0457#AN1254)   |

Anomalous use of ICMP or UDP by non-network service processes for data exfiltration or remote control, especially if traffic bypasses proxy infrastructure or shows unusual flow patterns.

|  [AN1255](https://attack.mitre.org/detectionstrategies/DET0457#AN1255)   |

ICMP or raw socket traffic generated by user-mode processes like bash, Python, or nc, typically using ping, hping3, or crafted packets via libpcap or scapy.

|  [AN1256](https://attack.mitre.org/detectionstrategies/DET0457#AN1256)   |

Unsigned binaries or interpreted scripts initiating non-standard protocols (ICMP, UDP, SOCKS) outside of baseline network behavior.

|  [AN1257](https://attack.mitre.org/detectionstrategies/DET0457#AN1257)   |

VMCI (Virtual Machine Communication Interface) traffic between guest and host, or between VMs, originating from non-management tools or unauthorized binaries.

|  [AN1258](https://attack.mitre.org/detectionstrategies/DET0457#AN1258)   |

Non-standard port/protocol pairings or low-entropy ICMP traffic resembling tunneling patterns (e.g., fixed-size pings with delays).
